===========

**work in progress**

Little web application to collect your web findings. Minimal interface.

- **categorize** what is the link intended for: read, watch, visit regularly, ...
- **tag** make your links easy to filter
- **search** simple and fast
- **mark as done** collecting lots of article links, you read once? mark them as read and be done with it
- **multi-user**
- **automatic thumbnail generation** if no thumbnail can be calculated, uses cutycapt to take a snapshot of the page
